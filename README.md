# 👋 Hi, I'm Ricky

**`Full-Stack Developer & AI Engineer | Building solutions that won't let me sleep until they work`**

I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Debrecen and a Full-Stack AI Trainer at Invisible Technologies. I have this unique ability to dive deep into technical problems and emerge with working solutions—whether it's self-hosting AI models, building full-stack applications, or teaching the next generation of developers. When I encounter a challenge, I don't rest until it's solved.

I specialize in building AI-powered applications that solve real-world problems, from intelligent search engines serving 200+ students to AI vision models extracting critical information from documents. Every project I build goes from concept to production, leveraging modern web technologies and machine learning.
